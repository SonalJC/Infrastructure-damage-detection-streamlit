# Infrastructure Damage Detection

A deep learning project that detects structural damage in infrastructure from images using **MobileNetV2** and **Streamlit**.

---

## About The Project

Identifying infrastructure damage quickly is critical in disaster response and civil engineering. This project uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to automatically classify whether a structure is damaged or not — deployed as a real-time web application.
